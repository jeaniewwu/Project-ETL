Description of the Project:

Extract data from sources to inform about breast cancer demographics in the United States. 
Dataset contains different data types like integers, strings, and floats. The “National Cancer 
Institute” provides a table lookup options such as area, area type, cancer, race/ethnicity, sex, 
age, stage and year for us to query and web-scrape. The second source comes from Kaggle, 
which contains data on a study done on different patients with different demographics. At this 
point in the ETL process, a non-relational database would be appropriate.
